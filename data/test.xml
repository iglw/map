		<cityName>Wolf's Hold</cityName>
		<cityImg>default.png</cityImg>
		<cityDesc>More a collection of a dozen war camps that entrenched for many years than a city, Wolf's Hold is the western most Northern Orc settlement. Nearly forty years past the Great Ice Wolf Korsha Eyeater gathered a number of rival tribes together and marched on the Black City. The war stalemated and with the rise of Joragath the war camps settled in to a loose city-like state. With trade to the Burning Mountain feeding them weapons, and raids on Wildforge lands for food they are about as close to a settled sustainable people as the orcs can be without stealing the city itself from another race.</cityDesc>

		<cityDesc>There are few places in the world with larger steel working operations than the Burning Mountain, and none so open to the world. Nestled between the jagged peaks lava flows pour forth endlessly, feeding the war machine that takes up the days and nights of the dwarven city that calls this sulfurous pit home. The people of of the Burning Mountain are a hard hearted and hardy bunch who trade with the Black City and others for food, handing out weapons and armour with out a thought to who gets them.</cityDesc>

		<cityImg>default.png</cityImg>
		<cityDesc>Black City is a large stone city built in to the hills around it, but has been burned and sacked so badly in the past that it is to this day stained. It is home to a vast population of half orc, and is one of the few city in the world to be home to both orc and men in a state of peace. The warlord ruler of the city is a half orc who has claimed to be of royal blood on both sides, few believe this claim but fewer speak of it out loud. Warlord Joragath of Two-Bloods holds a fragile peace in his hands and leaves trade open between the two peoples for now.</cityDesc>

It is ruled by what ever tribal leader can hold power and while they are at peace with the goblin tribes, and elves, they view all others as enemies.</cityDesc>

		<cityDesc>Farpeak was built to prove mans power, to rule form shore to shore. Though the empire has long ago broken in to small parts and the true king is long dead, Farpeak still answers to the 'throne' in Amonarino, but has a hard time keeping from falling under it's neighbours control.</cityDesc>

So long ago was it that man came to this place that none can recall the genesis of this place. The locals can only tell of the Holy Emperor born of the Sun and Moon leading his people to this land, taming the Field, Forest and Tide to feed and care for his people.</cityDesc>

		<cityDesc>Glacier Peak is a mighty tower of ice and no one knows who built it. The whole thing floated south from the high north one very hot summer, and the orc tribes simply moved in and took over. The tower itself was clearly for creatures not unlike the orc, although somewhat shorter.</cityDesc>

It is from the Vale that all water, and as such 'life' flows. It's people are rich and prone to building towers and grand edifice that are not normally bothered with by dwarven kind.</cityDesc>

Named as it is by the orc warlord Jkar Elfbane when he first took control of the city, meant as a jab at the defeated elven forces. Now it is the lumber capital of the badlands orcs and the heart of the war efforts northward in to the elven jungles, though it is hampered by the dwarves of the Valley of the Eldest.</cityDesc>

		<cityDesc>To most humans and halflings Selious is a wonder to the eye, while dwarf kind think of it as foolish and could be knocked over with a breeze. The city is formed in the lush jungle, over the last edges of the Ice Mountain River, formed like a bridge and tree house high above the ground. The elves here are of the most peaceful to outsider, bare orcs. This is the main point of warfare between badlands orcs and the elven peoples. It is an odd place where elves wield much dwarf crafted steel.</cityDesc>

Still, few dwarf cities are host to such a veteran force of warriors as there is no shortage of foes to face, and motivation to face them.</cityDesc>

The city itself is well guarded, and while not rich, it does not lack for mineral wealth.</cityDesc>

		<cityDesc>Not a true Thanedom, the Barrow Den is a home forged by dozens of small clan-less families over 600 years ago. Together they carved out a new home in the quite out of the way mountains and here they have formed a new clan, and a new name. Few dwarven clans, cities or thanes care for Barrow Den, as it spits in the face of tradition and history. As such the people of this city stick to themselves and rarely deal with any outsiders, even to trade.</cityDesc>
